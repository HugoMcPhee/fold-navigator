# fold-navigator package

<p>
Fold navigator helps you navigate through your code folding points in Atom.
</p>
<p>
Note: This package is in its infancy. I am only using it on a Mac. There might still be bugs. No test were written for it yet.
</p>
<p>
I was missing Netbeans code navigator so much I had to come up with something which helps me navigate through my code in Atom.
</p>
<p>
Try it and see. Fell free to suggest and let me know if you have any issues/bugs.
</p>
<p>
All shortcuts start with: ctrl-alt-cmd.
</p>
<p>
ctrl-alt-cmd-left: Opens the fold navigator panel.<br>
ctrl-alt-cmd-right: Close the fold navigator panel.<br>
ctrl-alt-cmd-up: Moves the cursor to the previous fold point.<br>
ctrl-alt-cmd-down: Moves the cursor to the next fold point.<br>
</p>
<p>
It can keep your code folded at all times as you navigate through the code.
</p>
<p>
It gives you the option to fold all code on file open.
